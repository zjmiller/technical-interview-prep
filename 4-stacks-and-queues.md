## Stacks and Queues

Two important data structures to be familar with are stacks and queues. Each are linear lists that allow you to add and remove items. With a stack, when you remove an item, you remove the last item that was added. Hence, stacks are first in last out (LIFO). With a queue, when you remove an item, you remove the first (remaining) item that was added. Hence, queues are first in first out (FIFO).
